#.Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:

Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.
Return s after removing all occurrences of part.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

class Solution {
    public String removeOccurrences(String s, String part) {
        // Repeatedly remove the leftmost occurrence of 'part'
        while (s.contains(part)) {
            s = s.replaceFirst(part, ""); // Removes the first occurrence of 'part'
        }
        return s; // Return the final string after removal
    }
}
